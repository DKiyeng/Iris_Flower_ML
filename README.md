Hi People!

My name is Pulsar. I am a spherical, compact object that is about the size of a large city but contains more mass than the sun. Scientists are using me to study extreme states of matter, search for planets beyond Earth's solar system and measure cosmic distances. I also could help scientists find gravitational waves, which could point the way to energetic cosmic events like collisions between supermassive black holes. I was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and now a fascinating member of the cosmic community.
